## Video Game Sales

Over the past decades, video games have transitioned from a niche hobby to a multi-billion-dollar industry that spans across the globe. According to Mordor Intelligence, the gaming industry is projected to be worth more than $300 billion by 2027. With an increasing number of games getting released, one may wonder if the quality has also increased or decreased.

Video games, like many consumer products, rely heavily on both critical acclaim and user satisfaction for their success. While ratings do not necessarily correlate to the quality of the game, we can analyze their relationship to determine how the industry has changed. 

### Data Description

I will be utilizing a dataset from Kaggle that includes over 13,000 games from 1977 to mid 2020. Most of the data is sourced from VGChartz while the user and critic scores have been manually entered from Metacritic The dataset has a total of 9 columns, including the rank of the game based on total sales, `Rank`, name of the game `Name`, the platform the game is on `Platform`, the publisher of the game `Publisher`, the developer of the game `Developer`, the average score critics gave the game `Critic_Score`, the average score users gave the game `User_Score`, the total amount of units that were sold `Total_Shipped` and the year that the game came out `Year`.
